# AI Agents Hub

This project consolidates several Streamlit-based agents into a single multi-page app.

## Available Agents

- Arbitrage Calculator
- Grammar Checker
- AI Sports Betting Agent
- Bobby Bets Sports Analysis
- Crypto Technical Analysis

## Running the App

Install the dependencies and start Streamlit from the repository root:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run main.py
```

Use the sidebar to navigate between pages. Each page simply wraps the original script for its agent so you can access them all in one interface.
